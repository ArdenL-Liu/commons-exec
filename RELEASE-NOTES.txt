              Apache Commons Exec 1.2 RELEASE NOTES

The Apache Commons Exec team is pleased to announce the Apache commons-exec-1.2 release!

Apache Commons Exec is a library to reliably execute external processes from within the JVM.

Changes in this version include:

New features:

o Set names for started threads.  Issue: EXEC-55. Thanks to Dominik Stadler. 

Fixed Bugs:

o Watchdog kills process immediately if timeout is too large.  Issue: EXEC-68. Thanks to Joel McCance. 
o Applied the patch from Nickolay Martinov but the timeout disguises the fact
                that the process might be still runnung - therefore added a sanity check in
                order to throw an exception if the the timeout for join() was exceeded.  Issue: EXEC-57. Thanks to Nickolay Martinov. 
o Fixed dead lock by calling the timeout observers outside of the synchronized block thereby
                removing on pre-requisite of a deadlock. Also added a test case to demonstrate that this
                problem is fixed (which of course can not guarantee the absence of a dead lock).  Issue: EXEC-60. Thanks to Peter Kofler. 
o Tests fail on HP-UX, because it uses a different syntax for the ping command.  Issue: EXEC-52. Thanks to Nickolay Martinov. 
o "Write dead end" IOException when using Piped streams w/PumpStreamHandler.
                When encountering a PipedOutputStream we will automatically close it to avoid
                the exception.  Issue: EXEC-49. Thanks to Kevin Telford. 
o Race condition prevent watchdog working using ExecuteStreamHandler.
                Patch submittd by Kristian Rosenvold.  Issue: EXEC-34. Thanks to Marco Ferrante.
